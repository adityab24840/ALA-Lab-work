    "3. You will have to fill the TODO question marks to compile those notebook cells and proceed to next cells\n",

    "5. Sessional is open book. Google, github, browse product documentation ChatGPT - Do anything you want, except copying from your classmates (Sending questions to your seniors and seeking answers is prohibited). If you are caught carrying out these illegal activities, you will be reported to MSIS Director for immediate action. \n",
    "6. You CANNOT replace the TODO code template with some other code copied from stack overflow, ChatGPT etc. All your browsing and search should give you insights into finally how you can fit that into the framework I provide for the thought process of solving the problem in this notebook. You will have to mandatorily fill the question marks and proceed with the lab problem."
